**Stress and Anxiety Management App (iOS)**

This application was developed as part of a Florida International University Capstone II Project with the goal of helping users manage stress and anxiety through daily activities. 
The app provides an easy-to-use interface and includes tools designed to encourage mindfulness, emotional awareness, and consistent self‑care habits.

**Overview**

The Stress and Anxiety Management App enables users to engage in a variety of wellness activities, each with its own daily logging system supported by a built‑in calendar view. The core features include:

**Reflection Questions:** Users answer daily reflective prompts to better understand thoughts and emotions.

**Mood Tracker:** Record mood entries each day to visualize emotional trends over time.

**Breathing Exercises:** Guided breathing activities to help users calm their mind and reduce stress.

**Diary:** A simple journaling tool that allows users to document their day or express feelings freely.

Each activity integrates with a calendar-based logging system, enabling users to track their participation and view past entries.

The app is developed using Flutter, with full support for iOS devices.
